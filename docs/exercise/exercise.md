Project idea short description: 

A web application to easily track your school grades.
- simple Login
- CRUD features for a semester
- CRUD features for a subject / module

I'm particular proud of:


## Project grading 

Static html description given and fully valid.

The application works nicely.

Functionality is in principle CRUD operations over 4 domain classes with one-to-many relations with
specialized views per user/semester. User login with basic management.

Git log is very good.
Some good unit tests, some tests failing (default), no UI integration tests.
HTML validity has some issues. First and foremost: Duplicate ID _method.

Since you hit the ceiling anyway, I spare the effort of grading extra points.
Anyway, I appreciate your use of taglibs and interceptors and the overall nice
appearance of the application.

Congratulations! 
Very nicely done.

Grade: 6.0
